    - Yes! That's why we've built the editing tools on this site. It's easy to
      share a link to your article on social media and crowdsource expert-level

- Can I cross-post on my own blog?
    - Yes!  But from an SEO perspective, Google will hit us with a duplicate
      content penalty if we both post it without being careful about it.  Here
      is what to do:

    - Wait 2 weeks before posting, from the day it goes live on HackHands
    - From inside your blog's version of the article, link back to the
       original source on HackHands, using the tag "rel=canonical".  The
       canonical tag makes it clear to Google that the content is syndicated.
       See this article about the [Canonical tag](http://www.shoutmeloud.com/relcanonical-wordpresss-content-syndication-seo.html").
- What types of articles are you looking for?
    - We're generally looking for tutorials on programing with X where X is a
      technology or library you're passionate about.
- How long should the article be?
    - What's most important is that its a definitive article on the subject, is
      super useful, and is linked-to from other sites.  Longform articles are a
      great fit for this.
- What type of content are you looking for?
    - In general, content marketing is very hit-driven.  95% of posts don't get
      results, but the ones that do make up for all the others that don't.  So
      that's why the only strategy that generally works is to write fewer
      pieces that are more definitive in nature.
    - The goal is that when someone does a google search for this subject, that
      your article appears on the first page of results.  For that to occur, we
      need the quality of the content to be high enough that many other sites
      link into your article because its definitive.
- How do I know if my article idea has a good chance of getting high traffic?
    - One easy thing you can do is to check-out the competition for SEO for
      this particular subject.  Try doing a quick search now for some topics
      that interest you.  Competition is generally OK so long as there is
      enough unique/useful content that sets your article apart from the
      competition.  Are there ideas you can talk about in your proposed article
      that hasn't already been written?  Enough interesting unique
      contributions that can be added that moves the world's knowledge forward?
      Those are some things to think about.
