- What type of content are you looking for?
    - In general, content marketing is very hit-driven.  95% of posts don't get
      results, but the ones that do make up for all the others that don't.  So
      that's why the only strategy that generally works is to write fewer
      pieces that are more definitive in nature.
    - The goal is that when someone does a google search for this subject, that

      link into your article because its definitive.
- How do I know if my article idea has a good chance of getting high traffic?
    - One easy thing you can do is to check-out the competition for SEO for
      this particular subject.  Try doing a quick search now for some topics
      that interest you.  Competition is generally OK so long as there is
      enough unique/useful content that sets your article apart from the
      competition.  Are there ideas you can talk about in your proposed article
      that hasn't already been written?  Enough interesting unique
      contributions that can be added that moves the world's knowledge forward?
      Those are some things to think about.
