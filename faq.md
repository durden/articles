Welcome!  This is a community for collaborating on creating great technical tutorials.
Our collective aim is by working together, we can educate the world, plus improve our knowledge.
Think of this as a "Wikipedia" for technical tutorials.

## Why would I contribute tutorials here?
- Give your expertise back to the community
- The best way to learn for yourself is to teach others
- Our community collectively offers promotion and distribution of your tutorials to a wide audience (much more than a personal blog post)
- We can help you promote the content on HackerNews to get a lot of eyeballs and traffic
- Our community can help improve your tutorials with peer review of your content
- Improve your personal brand by being a thought leader, leading to opportunities for your career
- If you write a very high quality tutorial, we'll give you a free subscription to Pluralsight, so that you can keep your skils sharp.
- If you've created any Pluralsight videos, your tutorials can promote those videos you've created, earning more income

## What is the technology behind this site?
- It's super cool - we use Github for article storage, and Markdown as the file format.  So the same tools you're accustomed to.  Way better than Wordpress!  We've open-sourced all of it.
- Even this file is a Markdown file.  You can help us edit and improve it!

## What types of tutorials are appropriate to post?
- Technical tutorials.  Feel free to write about any technology that you're passionate about.
- We'd encourage you to write high-quality content that improves the world's knowledge about the subject.

## How long should tutorials be?
- What we're trying to create are definitive tutorials on technical subjects.  Longform articles are a great fit for this.

## Can you help me edit/revise the article?
- Yes! That's why we've built the editing tools on this site. It's easy to share a link to your article on social media and crowdsource expert-level editors for your topic.  You'll be able to see suggestions from the community and accept the changes you want.  Our editors can help improve it too.

## What type of content is appropriate to post?
- In general, content marketing is very hit-driven.  95% of posts don't get results, but the ones that do make up for all the others that don't.  So that's why the only strategy that generally works is to write fewer pieces that are more definitive in nature.

## How do I know if my tutorial idea is any good?
- One easy thing you can do is to check-out what else is out their for this particular subject.  Try doing a quick search now for some topics that interest you.  Other articles are generally OK so long as there is enough unique/useful content that sets your article apart.  Are there ideas you can talk about in your proposed article that hasn't already been written?  Enough interesting unique contributions that can be added that moves the world's knowledge forward? Those are some things to think about.

## What is the writing process?
1) [Submit an tutorial](/write/)
2) Share a link for suggestions to your article with friends, co-workers, etc.
3) Continue improving your article with the community help
4) Our editors will also assist you with improving your article
