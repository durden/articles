[Beyond PEP 8 -- Best practices for beautiful intelligible
code](http://pyvideo.org/video/3511/beyond-pep-8-best-practices-for-beautiful-inte)
is another great talk by the Python-famous Raymond Hettinger. Each year at
[Pycon US](https://us.pycon.org/2015/) Mr. Hettinger manages to teach a roomful
of experts **and** novices something useful. This is an incredibly difficult
thing to do. His most 
[recent Pycon talk about PEP8](http://pyvideo.org/video/3511/beyond-pep-8-best-practices-for-beautiful-inte)
provides key insights for beginners and seasoned veterans alike as he focuses
on the practice of 'PEP8-ing' code.

I'm sure you're familiar with this term if you've worked a
[Python](http://python.org) application with more than 1 developer in the past.
Typically a newcomer on the project will try to get involved and go around
cleaning up whitespace, line lengths, and other miscellaneous things that tools
like [Pylint](http://www.pylint.org) complain about. As Mr. Hettinger points out,
this *can* be useful. It can also contribute to the superficial score Pylint
gives your code. Unfortunately, these PEP8-ing sessions can lead to subtle
bugs.

So, [Mr. Hettinger's
talk](http://pyvideo.org/video/3511/beyond-pep-8-best-practices-for-beautiful-inte)
is **not** about this kind of PEP8-ing. Instead he focuses on how to modify
and simplify existing code to conform to more Pythonic standards. These
standards aren't represented in
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), but they are arguably more
important to code quality. I don't want to give anything away so you'll have
to watch the talk. Do yourself a favor and spend 50 minutes today watching Mr.
Hettinger walk you through transforming a Java API into a clean Python API.
You'll probably be surprised at how useful his tips are for your own code.
