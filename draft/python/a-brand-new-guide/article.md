# Simple debugging with meta programming

The 'watch' feature of modern debuggers allows a developer to see when a
variable changes state.  I use this feature a lot when doing small debugging sprints.  Unfortunately, using it requires opening up a big [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) like [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).  I prefer to work primarily with the [command line](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and [vim](http://www.vim.org/about.php).

So, I decided to write my own debugging 'utility' to handle very simple approach to this 'watching' debugging work flow.

## Requirements

1. Easy to use
2. Track several attributes at once
3. Display when variable changes and what its' new value is
4. Display stack trace/location where watched variable changes

## Attribute setting

The first step is to somehow track when any variable is set.  Luckily, [Python](http://python.org) provides a [mechanism](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__seattr__) solely for this purpose [1].  The `__setattr__` [method](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setattr__) is called each time an attribute is set (before the actual assignment
takes place).

### Watching specific attributes

Now we need a list of what attributes to watch.  Then, we can provide a custom
`__setattr__` [method](http://docs.python.org/2/reference/datamodel.html#object.__setattr__) that watches each attribute 'set' action and alert us when a specific attribute changes.

[code lang="python"]
    def __setattr__(self, name, value):
        if name in ['myvar1', 'myvar2']:
            import traceback
            import sys
            # Print stack (without this __setattr__ call)
            traceback.print_stack(sys._getframe(1))
            print '%s -> %s = %s' % (repr(self), name, value)
[/code]

The above approach works, but it doesn't give us much flexibility.

What if I want to use this functionality in another class?  This would require
copying the whole method followed by a small change to the list of
attributes.  It seems like a shame to copy/paste all that code verbatim and
then only change a single line.  There must be a better way...

### Steps to re-usability

We can be a bit more critical about the proposed solution and notice the
following:

1. The solution tightly couples the list of attributes and the real
   implementation details.
2. We will always override the same method, `__setattr__`.
3. This method must always exist inside of a class to work.

We need a way to pass a list of attribute names to a class method to watch all
'set' actions for these attributes.  So, to be more precise and technical, 
we want override a built-in class method in a generic way and pass it a single
argument, a list of attributes to watch.

### Potential solution

This sounds like a great use of a
[Class Decorator](http://blog.genforma.com/2011/07/28/class-decorator-talk/).
This is a perfect use case since the only information needed up front is the
attributes to watch.  Then, we could add this behavior to any class
simply by using the `@` decorator syntax.

So, without further ado:

[gist 4081514]

In a nutshell, we make our own `_setattr` method and then replace the decorated
class's `__setattr__` with our own.  So, to watch attributes in a class simply
put `@watch_variables` above your class with a list of attribute names.  For
example:

[code lang="python"]
    @watch_variables(['foo', 'bar'])
    class BuggyClass(object):
        def __init__(self, foo, bar):
            self.foo = foo
            self.bar = bar
[/code]

### Good Enough?

Unfortunately, this solution has one major drawback.  It cannot track changes
to mutable attributes.  For example, this decorator cannot alert you if your
class has a `list` attribute and it's modified by appending or some other
mechanism.

The `append()` method and other related list modification mechanisms are
methods on the `list` attribute, not our class.  Thus, our custom version of
`__setattr__` will never be called.

I'm sure this functionality could be added.  However, it wasn't immediately
obvious to me at the time, and the above solution worked for my most recent
debugging sprint.

So, go show off your skills and
[fork my solution](https://gist.github.com/4081514) and 'fix' this deficiency
or point out a better solution altogether!

[1] I briefly discussed connecting to Python's attribute setting mechanism 
during my [dunder talk](http://durden.github.com/dunder_talk/?full#1) so check
that out if this sort of functionality interests you.
