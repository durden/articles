As a HackHands expert I've often seen this JavaScript problem which people don't
understand how to fix.

Lets consider this example:

```javascript
var array = [ ... ]; // An array with some objects
for( var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i )
{
  $.doSthWithCallbacks( function() {
    array[i].something = 42;
  });
}
```

While this code looks perfectly fine, it shows the misunderstanding of a very
basic JavaScript concept. Now for an expert like myself this error is quite
easy to spot and I am rather used to similar problems, but often that's not the
case with most people, who can literally spend hours trying to figure out why
their code isn't working.

Explanation
-----------

Remember those first JavaScript tutorials you've read where it said that
JavaScript is asynchronous... This means that under some circumstances code
might not be executed sequentially. This is usually the case when using internal
APIs that depend on an external event. For example processing a response after
an HTTP request is completed or after some other processing is done.

So what happens is that the `doSthWithCallbacks`
_(general expression for all JavaScript function that use a callback)_ schedules
the callback function to be executed at a later stage. But the `for` loop isn't
just scheduling one callback. It's scheduling an `array.length` worth of
callbacks and they most certainly won't be completed within the same `for` loop
iteration. Each of those callbacks will be executed at an unpredictable time
later, when multiple `for` iterations had gone through, the value if `i` is
different and multiple other callbacks had also been scheduled.

Usually the callbacks aren't executed until the `for` loop has completed at
which point `i` is exactly equal to `array.length - 1`. So every time any of the
callbacks is executed it will be modifying the last value of the array instead
of the value of the `for` loop iteration it was scheduled on. Of course as I
said it is unpredictable when the callbacks will be executed and depends on
multiple factors the JavaScript interpreter used, the function invoking the
callbacks and it's input data. An example is an HTTP request with a success
callback that won't be executed before the server sends a response, which could
be any time interval between several milliseconds and several minutes.

How to work around it
----------------------

What you would like to do is create separate callback functions that have their
own copy of the value of `i` in a scope only available to them. This brings me
to my most favorite JavaScript hack. This is done by declaring a self called
anonymous function which generally looks like this:

```javascript
(function() {
  // Something declared here will only be available to the function below.
  // Code here is executed only once upon the creation of the inner function
  return function( callbackArguments ) {
    // Actual callback here
  }
}) (); // The last brackets execute the outer function
```

Note that the outer function is only used for encapsulating the inner function
and creating a separate variable scope for the inner function. Also the outer
function returns a value of type `Function` which is the exact type a callback
should be.

So applying this to the previous example we arrive at this:

```javascript
var array = [ ... ]; // An array with some objects
for( var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i )
{
  API.doSthWithCallbacks( (function() {
    var j = i; // j is a copy of i only available to the scope of the inner function
    return function() {
      array[j].something = 42;
    }
  })() );
}
```

If for example you have to do some asynchronous processing and there should be
some aggregate code that should only be ran after all the callbacks had been
completed, this is how you will do it:

```javascript
var array = [ ... ]; // An array with some objects
var count = 0, length = array.length;
for( var i = 0; i < array.length; ++i )
{
  API.doSthWithCallbacks( (function() {
    var j = i; // A copy of i only available to the scope of the inner function
    return function() {
      array[j].something = 42;

      ++count;
      if( count == length ) {
        // Code executed only after all the processing tasks have been completed
      }
    }
  })() );
}
```

Now at this point people are often confused. Is the `++count` operation atomic?
A [Race Condition][wiki-race-condition] could occur and the code might be
executed multiple times or worse - not executed at all. Some consider something
like a mutex or a semaphore. Wrong! While JavaScript is asynchronous, it is not
multithreaded. In fact while it is impossible to predict when a callback will be
executed, it is guaranteed that a Race Condition will not occur since JavaScript
only runs in a single thread. _(As a side note, that doesn't mean there isn't a
way to run multiple threads in JavaScript. See
[Web Workers API][mdn-js-workers-api] for the Web kind of JavaScript)_.

Practice Problem
----------------

I've prepared a [Practice Problem][jsfiddle-practice-problem] demonstrating the
issue and if you would like, you can give it a try. When attempting it, only
edit the code within the designated section. There are multiple ways to do it,
but one of the best is using the technique that I showed you.
