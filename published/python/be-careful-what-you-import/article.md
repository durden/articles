I learned a lesson recently about being careful what you import into a
[Python](http://python.org) application. The majority of the time I just find
the module I need, import, use, and then move on. However, sometimes an
[unnecessary import](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/modules.html) can
lead to a big waste of memory.

### Searching imports dynamically

I learned this lesson while recently writing a
[tool](https://gist.github.com/durden/4723305) to search a
[Python](http://python.org)
[module](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html) and/or
[package](http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html#packages) for a given
object. The script is interesting and worth another post all on it's own. The
[gist](https://gist.github.com/durden/4723305) is you provide the script with
two arguments, the module/package to search and a term to search for. The
script should then give you a listing of all the places it found an object
containing your search term.

For example, the documentation for
[PyQt4](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) can be pretty
tough to search. I tend to use the standard [Qt](http://qt.digia.com/)
documentation and then translate any examples I find into code for the
[Python PyQt4 wrapper](http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro).

### Duplicates?

I was testing my script with various terms I tend to use in PyQt4 applications
such as `MinimumExpanding` and `NoEditTriggers`:

    python import_searcher.py -s MinimumExpanding

    PyQt4.Qt.QSizePolicy.MinimumExpanding = 3
    PyQt4.QtGui.QSizePolicy.MinimumExpanding = 3
    PyQt4.Qwt5.qplt.QSizePolicy.MinimumExpanding = 3

Notice anything odd about the above output? Looks like `MinimumExpanding`
shows up in two almost identical locations, `PyQt4.Qt` and `PyQt.QtGui`.
Naturally, I thought there was a bug in my script, but after some debugging and
reading I found the following jewel on the
[PyQt4 wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyQt):

> The Qt module consolidates the classes contained in all of the modules

So, using the `PyQt4.Qt` module is actually redundant and only for convenience.
The noticeable downside, besides redundancy, is it can actually import a lot of
*large* modules that aren't typically needed such as
[QtDesigner](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qtdesigner.html),
[QtWebKit](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qtwebkit.html), and
[QtHelp](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/qtnetwork.html).

For example, assume your application is only using the `PyQt4.QtGui` module and
then you mistakenly decide you need something from `PyQt4.Qt`. This single
import could essentially double your memory usage [1]:

        22 #from PyQt4 import QtAxContainer
        23 19.387 MB 6.543 MB from PyQt4 import Qt

Note that just importing 'PyQt4.Qt' increased the application memory usage by
**6.543 MB**. This could be costly depending on how much memory your
application was already using and how much your system has available.

### Moral takeaways

1. Be careful of what you import. It could be redundant or costly, possibly
   both.

2. Carefully read documentation. The
   [main PyQt4 documentation](http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/modules.html)
   alludes to this redundant `PyQt4.Qt` module by describing it with the
   following, "**Consolidates all other modules into a single module for ease
   of use at the expense of memory.**"

3. Don't forget to try stuff, play, and have some fun coding. A one-off
   [script](https://gist.github.com/durden/4723305) can lead to a nice, useful
   discovery.
